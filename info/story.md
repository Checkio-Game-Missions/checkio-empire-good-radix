We should continue to teach our robots more complex number operations and reporting. 
For this mission, we need to train them on a variety of numeral systems.

In mathematical numeral systems, the radix or base, is the number of unique digits (including zero) 
that a positional numeral system uses to represent numbers. For example: in the decimal system, 
the radix is ten. This is because it has ten digits from 0 through 9. In a system with a radix of 13, 
there would be 13 digits. For example: a string of digits such as 398 denotes 
the decimal number 3 * 13^2 + 9 * 13^1 + 8 * 13^0. For the systems with a radix more than 10,
 we will use capital Latin symbols from A to Z, where A = 10, B = 11 ...
